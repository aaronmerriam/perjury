Welcome to Perjury's documentation!
===================================

Perjury is a suite of tools for content generations.  The overall goal of this
module is to both provide a thorough set of tools for generating fake content,
and to make writing new generators or extending existing generators a simple
process.

We want developers to spend time developing, rather than populating fake blod
entries with fake content.
